<h1>As Into the Garden <?php echo $girl; ?> Ran</h1>
<h2>(original by Alfred Edward Housman)</h2>
<p>As into the garden <?php echo $girl; ?> ran<br />
Pursued by the <?php echo $adjective1; ?> indignation of Ann,<br />
She trod on an object that lay in her road,<br />
She trod on an object that <?php echo $pastverb1; ?> like a toad.</p>

<p>It <?php echo $pastverb1; ?> like a toad, and it <?php echo $pastverb1; ?> so because<br />
A toad was the actual object it was;<br />
And after supporting <?php echo $girl; ?>'s tread<br />
It <?php echo $pastverb1; ?> like a toad that was visibly dead.</p>

<p><?php echo $girl; ?>, leaving her footprint behind,<br />
Continued her flight on the <?php echo $bodypart; ?> of the wind,<br />
And Ann in her <?php echo $noun1; ?> was heard to arrive<br />
At the toad that was not any longer alive.</p>

<p>She was heard to arrive, for the <?php echo $noun2; ?> rang<br />
With the sound of a <?php echo $noisy; ?> and the noise of a bang,<br />
As her breath on the breezes she <?php echo $adverb; ?> bestowed<br />
And fainted away on <?php echo $girl; ?>'s toad.</p>

<p><?php echo $girl; ?>, saved by the sole of her boot,<br />
Escaped her <?php echo $adjective2; ?> sister's pursuit;<br />
And if ever hereafter she irritates Ann,<br />
She will tread on a toad if she possibly can.</p>
