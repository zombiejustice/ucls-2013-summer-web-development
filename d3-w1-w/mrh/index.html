<h1>Mr. H's Homepage</h1>
<p>Mr. H likes making dinosaur noises and teaching people about web design. Mr. H dislikes volcanos and people wearing headphones in class. Actually, he dislikes rudeness in general, not just the headphone thing. And nothing is more rude than a volcano.</p>

<li>Create a new folder called 'madlibs' (with NO spaces) in your main folder. Create a new file inside the 'madlibs' folder called 'index.html'. Use this <em>exact</em> name and location.</li>
<li>Mark up the basic HTML elements, including a title. Include a form with text boxes for adjectives and nouns.</li>
<li>Make a second page, giving it whatever name you want, but make sure the file extension is .html . This will be the page where the 'finished' mad lib can be read.</li>
<li>Use PHP to collect the adjectives and nouns out of the URL and insert them into the story.</li>
<li>Style the pages attractively.</li>
<li>Check your work using the test page:</li>

<p>If you want to work from home on a Windows computer (Dell, HP, et cetera), Mr. H has typed up some helpful directions.</p>

<p>Mr. H and Maddie are here to teach you web design, but if you have a question, remember to first ask a neighbor, and then try looking it up on w3schools, before raising your hand.</p>
